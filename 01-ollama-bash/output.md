Sure, I can provide you with a simple "Hello, World!" program in Golang. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Install Go:** First, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/doc/install
    - After downloading, you can verify the installation by running `go version` in your terminal. It should display the installed version of Go.
2. **Create a New File:** Open a text editor (like `vim` or `nano`) and create a new file. For example, you can name this file `hello.go`.
3. **Write the Code:** Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Golang:
    ```go
    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
    }
    ```
4. **Run the Program:** In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your `hello.go` file. Then, run the program using the command `go run hello.go`.
    - If everything is set up correctly, you should see the message "Hello, World!" printed out in your terminal.
5. **Understanding the Code:** Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
    - `package main` is the package name. In Go, all code must be inside a package.
    - `import "fmt"` is the standard library package for formatting text.
    - `func main()` is the entry point of the program. When you run the program, this function is called.
    - `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")` is a function call that prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
    - `main.go` is the name of the file.
    - `go run hello.go` is the command to run the program.
    - `go build hello.go` is the command to build the program, which will create an executable file in the same directory.
    - `go install hello.go` is the command to install the program, which will create a binary file in `$GOPATH/src` and `$GOPATH/bin`.
